## react-jsx-transform

React wrote (9/22/2020) about the new `JSX` transform being released in React 17. You can [read about it here][jsx]. When trying to spin up `cra` to test it out, it wouldn't use the new transform. So...

This repository is a quick little example of the new `JSX` transform being used in a React application using version `^17.0.0-rc.0`. I included a `yarn.lock` file for those using yarn, but you can just delete it if you want to use npm.

### Running (yarn)

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

### Running (npm)

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```
